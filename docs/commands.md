# BKG command reference

This plugin exposes six top-level OpenCode commands. Every visible command starts with `bkg-` and describes the action it performs.

## Current top-level commands

| Command | Purpose | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `/bkg-project-check` | Inspect repository, docs, state and starting context. | You need orientation before editing. |
| `/bkg-memory` | Read, write, validate and summarize project memory. | A decision, result or blocker must be remembered. |
| `/bkg-git` | Check status, pull, review diff, commit and push explicitly. | You need Git movement with visible evidence. |
| `/bkg-tasks` | Add, run, list, show and update tasks. | Work needs to be tracked before anyone claims it is done. |
| `/bkg-rules` | Check workflow rules, done criteria and release gates. | A result looks finished but still needs proof. |
| `/bkg-debate` | Start team debates, Agent Rat sessions, votes and delegation. | A plan, blocker, feature or approval needs multiple perspectives. |

## Plugin tools behind the commands

The commands can call plugin tools. The important maintenance tools are:

| Tool | Purpose | Mutates files? |
|---|---|---|
| `update_check` | Checks pinned plugin refs and returns suggested update prompts. | No |
| `sync_status` | Shows sync configuration and warnings. | No |
| `sync_push` | Copies configured OpenCode files into the sync repo, commits and pushes. | Yes, sync repo only |
| `sync_pull` | Pulls from sync repo and restores configured local files with backups. | Yes, local configured files |

`update_check` is intentionally read-only. It should ask/surface the update question, not silently rewrite config.

## Command discipline

These commands are the only top-level workflow commands. Everything else must stay a subcommand, skill, tool or agent action.

Expected work loop:

1. Start with `/bkg-project-check` to inspect state.
2. Use `/bkg-tasks` to create or select a concrete task.
3. Use `/bkg-debate` for blockers, plans, feature decisions or release approvals.
4. Use `/bkg-git` for visible Git movement.
5. Use `/bkg-rules` before claiming work is done.
6. Use `/bkg-memory` to save the result and relevant decisions.

## Legacy names

The old numeric and ambiguous command names are not primary commands anymore:

- `/0ero`
- `/1brain`
- `/2hit`
- `/3some`
- `/4ever`
- `/4ucker`
- `/bkg-zero`
- `/bkg-brain`
- `/bkg-hit`
- `/bkg-some`
- `/bkg-ever`
- `/bkg-fucker`

They should not be documented as active commands. If they appear after installation, reinstall assets and restart OpenCode.

## Local verification

After pulling the repository:

1. Run `npm run install:assets`.
2. Restart OpenCode.
3. Open `/` command search.
4. Confirm only the six current top-level BKG commands are visible.
5. Run or ask an agent to run `update_check` if you want update prompts.
6. Run `sync_status` before any sync push/pull.

If legacy commands still appear, the local OpenCode config likely still contains stale copied command files. Remove the old command files from the local OpenCode commands directory and reinstall assets.
